**Deliverable Submission**

Please describe your comfort and completeness levels before submitting.

Comfort Level (1-5): 3 - I was fairly comfortable until, I had to situate the words in the center of the images.

Completeness Level (1-5): 3.5~4. Looks fine at full screen, but it could be better.

Do you have any remaining questions about this deliverable?: What is a good way to "anchor" text to images in such a way that the text will stay with the image if the webpage size changes.
